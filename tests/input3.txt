The name Russia comes from a Medieval Latin name for Rus', a medieval state populated primarily by the East Slavs.[18][19] In modern historiography, this state is usually denoted as Kievan Rus' after its capital city.[20] The name Rus' itself comes from the early medieval Rus' people, who were originally a group of Norse merchants and warriors who relocated from across the Baltic Sea and first settled in the northern region of Novgorod, and later founded a state centred on Kiev.[21] Another Medieval Latin name for Rus' was Ruthenia.[22]
